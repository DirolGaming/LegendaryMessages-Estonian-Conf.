# LegendaryMessages Estonian Conf.
[LegendaryMessages](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/joinmessages/) is an Minecraft plugin.

Here are the LegendaryMessages conf files translated into Estonian.
I will update it when I have time.
You need to change some of the messages by yourself.These conf. files are all from the StoneMain server.

I recommend to test everything before you paste it to your conf file.
Use [online YAML parser](http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/) to test them.
